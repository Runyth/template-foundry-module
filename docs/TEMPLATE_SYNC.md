# Template synchronization

GitHub template repositories copy files into an unrelated new repository; they
do not create an upstream history relationship. Runyth therefore synchronizes
only declared managed files instead of merging template branches.

The monthly and manually triggered workflow:

1. checks out the module and current template;
2. reads the template's `.runyth/template-managed.json`;
3. applies only the declared managed platform files;
4. merges common package scripts without deleting module dependencies or
   custom scripts;
5. runs the module quality gate so the synchronized state is verified before it
   is committed;
6. records the applied template version;
7. commits the synchronized standard directly to the module's branch. Template
   synchronization does not require pull request review, so the managed
   platform files are committed by the workflow bot regardless of whether a
   module allows pull requests.

A run with no managed file changes commits nothing, so the recorded sync
timestamp only advances together with real platform changes.

Workflow pushes made with the repository token do not trigger further workflow
runs, so the in-workflow gate is the authoritative check for synchronized
commits. A separate automation token is unnecessary.

Module-owned runtime code, data, manifest, README, changelog, license,
module-specific documentation, and feature tests are never template-sync
targets. Module-owned helpers under a managed tree, such as `tools/module/`, are
preserved because trees are synchronized file by file.

## Managed path modes

- `replace`: overwrite a single file.
- `replace-tree`: replace an entire directory, deleting files that are no
  longer in the template.
- `sync-tree`: overwrite every file that exists in the template directory but
  leave module-owned files inside the same tree untouched.
- `merge-package`: merge shared `package.json` fields and scripts without
  removing module dependencies or custom scripts.

Run locally with:

```nu
npm run template:sync -- --source ../template-foundry-module
```
